# Breakbeat Generator for Schwung

A musically-anchored breakbeat slicer for Ableton Move (via Schwung).

Loads a WAV breakbeat, slices it into 8 equal parts, and recombines them per
trigger using biased-random selection. Designed for jungle, DnB, and breakbeat-
driven dance music: classic breaks (Amen, Funky Drummer, Think, Apache, etc.)
keep their kick-snare backbone via the **Anchor** knob, while **Roll**, **Fill**,
and **Phrase** add motion, fills, and multi-bar phrasing.

## Before you start... fix midi out
This uses midi out to get timing from the Move side of things. I'l see if there's a more elegant way to do this, but for now:

1. From the regular Move UI, get into Settings (shift-step 2, the little gear icon at the bottom)
2. Find Midi Sync (it will be in one of 3 modes, Off, In, Out)
3. Select it, set it to Out


## Controls

### Performance knobs (turn while playing)

| Knob | Range | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Complexity** | 0–100 | Probability that any given trigger picks a *random* slice instead of advancing in order. At 0, slices follow either Anchor (if engaged) or sequential advance. At 100, every non-stay trigger rolls a fresh random slice. |
| **Anchor** | 0–100 | Locks slice index to *beat position* in the bar. At 0, behavior matches the original module (sequential advance with random swaps). At 100, the no-swap fallback forces `slice = beat_position` — kick lands on every beat 1, snare lands on every beat 3. The locked weight curve also makes lock-zone slices unswappable: at high Anchor, beats 1 and 3 *never* get swapped out by Complexity. |
| **Roll** | 0–100 | Temporal stickiness. At 0, every trigger is independent. At 100, most triggers either repeat the current slice, walk to the ±1 neighbor, or take a 5% escape-hatch jump. Produces the rolling jungle "1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5" feel and held-slice stutters. |
| **Fill** | 0–100 | Intensity of the *fill bar* modulation. Only meaningful when **Phrase** is non-Off. Modulates Complexity ↑, Roll ↓, Anchor ↓ on the last bar of every phrase. At 0, fill bars play normally. At 100, the fill bar throws out the groove rules entirely. |
| **Retrigger** | 0–100 | Probability that any given trigger sub-divides the slice for a stutter repeat. |

### Settings (configure once, leave alone)

| Setting | Values | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **A Sample** | filepath | Selects which WAV to slice. Opens file browser. |
| **A Length** | enum | Trigger interval for A loop (1/4 bar to 8 bars). |
| **B Sample** | filepath | Selects the loop used for phrase fills. |
| **B Length** | enum | Trigger interval for B loop (1/4 bar to 8 bars). |
| **B Chance** | 0–100 | Probability of swapping to B Loop on the last bar of a phrase. |
| **Phrase** | enum | Multi-bar phrase length (Off, 2, 4, 8, 16 bars). |
| **Retrig Rate** | enum | Sub-divisions per retrigger event (2x, 3x, 4x, 8x, Rand). |

### Meta

| Knob | Values | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Preset** | enum | Selects a dynamic preset from `presets/` folder. |
| **Save Preset** | toggle | Saves current settings as a new JSON file in `presets/`. |
| **Status** | read-only | Displays current playing loop, slice, and retrig status (e.g., `A_3_1x`). |

## Dynamic Presets & Custom Samples

Presets are no longer hardcoded in C. They are stored as `.json` files in the `presets/` directory. The module scans this directory on startup and when saving a new preset.

To add custom presets, place a JSON file in the `presets/` folder on the device and restart or save a preset to rescan.

Custom samples can be loaded via the file browser for **A Sample** and **B Sample**. The browser opens in `/data/UserData/breakbeat-samples`, with symlinks to built-in samples and your User Library.

## How the algorithm picks slices

Each trigger tick:

1. **Phrase modulation** — if Phrase is set and we're on the fill bar, Complexity is pushed up, Roll and Anchor are pushed down (proportional to Fill).
2. **Roll the dice** — random number `r ∈ [0,1)`:
   - If `r < (1 - Roll)` → **Move** branch (independent decision)
   - Otherwise → **Stay** branch (correlated with previous slice)
3. **Move branch:**
   - Compute swap probability: `p_swap = Complexity * weight_at(beat_position, Anchor)`
   - If we swap → uniform random slice 0..7
   - Else → with probability **Anchor**, snap to `beat_position`; otherwise sequential advance from current slice
4. **Stay branch:**
   - 5% escape hatch: jump 2..4 forward
   - Otherwise: with probability `(1 - weight_at(current_slice, Anchor))` repeat current; else walk ±1

The **anchor weight curve** at Anchor=100 is `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.7, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.2]`:
- Slices 0 and 4 (beats 1 and 3) → weight 0 → never swap (kick/snare locked)
- Slice 7 (last 16th) → weight 1.2 → *more* likely to swap than baseline (fill territory)

Reseed happens automatically on transport start, so each play produces a fresh stochastic realization.

## Knob interactions worth knowing

- **Anchor=0, Roll=0, Phrase=Off** → original module behavior: sequential advance with Complexity-driven random swaps.
- **Anchor=100, Roll=0, Complexity=0** → straight playback of the break in beat order. At Length=0.5, this means slices 0, 2, 4, 6 (the structural beats only); at Length=0.25, slices 0..7 in order.
- **Anchor=100, Roll=100, Complexity=50** → camped on slice 0 with occasional ±1 walks and rare 5% escape jumps. Heavy stutter feel.
- **Anchor=80, Roll=70, Phrase=4, Fill=70** → bars 1–3 groove, bar 4 audibly opens up into a fill, bar 1 of the next phrase resets.
- **Phrase=2, Fill=100** → every other bar feels wild.

## Built-in Presets

Loaded dynamically from `src/presets/`:
- **1_calm**
- **2_mid**
- **3_frantic**

## UI Architecture

This module returns `ui_hierarchy` dynamically from C code as a compact JSON
string to enable the stock parameter list view in the Synth view of the host.
Do not use `ui_hierarchy` in `module.json` for instruments if you want this
behavior.

## Building

```bash
./scripts/build.sh    # cross-compiles dsp.so for aarch64 via Docker
./scripts/install.sh  # scp's to ableton@move.local
```

After install, restart Schwung on the device to load the module.

## Testing

Pure slice-selection logic is host-testable:

```bash
./tests/run_tests.sh  # compiles tests/test_slice_select.c and runs assertions
```

## SSH setup (Mac → Move)

The install script uses `scp`/`ssh` to push files to the device. If you get `Permission denied (publickey)`:

```bash
# Generate a key on your build machine
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/move -N ""

# Add it to the Move (run from a machine that already has access)
echo "$(cat ~/.ssh/move.pub)" | ssh ableton@move.local \
  "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

# Add a host entry so the key is picked up automatically
cat >> ~/.ssh/config << 'EOF'
Host move.local
    User ableton
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/move
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
EOF
```

If the Move's host key has changed (after a firmware update or reset), clear the stale entry first:
```bash
ssh-keygen -R move.local
```

## Changelog

### Startup fixes
- **Module now loads the `1_calm` preset immediately on startup.** Previously the module tried to load a hardcoded `amen.wav` path that doesn't exist, leaving `bb->data = NULL` and producing silence until the user changed a preset or muted/unmuted the slot.
- **Preset list is now sorted alphabetically** after scanning, so index 0 is always `1_calm` regardless of filesystem order.
- **State restore now applies the sample immediately** when the transport is stopped, instead of deferring it to the next MIDI clock bar boundary (which might never arrive on a fresh load).

### Sample-swap stability fix
- **Added `madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)` after every `mmap` call in `open_wav`.** Without this, the kernel loads WAV pages lazily — the first time `render_block` touches a freshly-loaded sample it triggers OS page faults on the audio thread, causing latency spikes that trip Schwung's render watchdog and kill the module. This was most noticeable when the phrase engine swapped to the B sample mid-performance (e.g. ramping tempo through a phrase boundary). Pre-faulting happens in the MIDI callback, well before the audio thread needs the data.
